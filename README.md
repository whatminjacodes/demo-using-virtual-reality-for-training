# demo-using-virtual-reality-for-training
Demo of how Virtual Reality can be used for training. This is my Master's Thesis project. WIP.

### Idea
The project is a proof-of-concept of how Virtual Reality can be used for teaching. In the demo the user learns how to handle an excavator.

### Setup
Download Oculus VR integration package from Asset Store. You also need an excavator 3D model. Full details will be written when the project is finished.
